# notes to self

ideas
- i could make bop more robust and make an interface for format conversion with `magick`
    - i could also add a viewer option

## parameters for cli later
- default is random, but user can input expression that will be passed to `int val` in `write()`
- maybe also `int thresh`
- come up with a framework for coloring
- later filetype (bmp, xpm, png maybe)

### todo
- [x] better expr generation
    - [ ] more constants
- [/] parameterization
- [ ] xpm
- [ ] input sanitization
- [ ] understand threshold better
- [ ] figure out good algorithms for coloring
- [ ] figure out user input for expressions
