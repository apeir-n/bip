# notes to self

## parameters for cli later
- default is random, but user can input expression that will be passed to `int val` in `write()`
- maybe also `int thresh`
- come up with a framework for coloring
- width and height
- filename
- later filetype (bmp, xpm, png maybe)

### todo
- [x] better expr generation
- [/] parameterization
- [ ] xpm
- [ ] figure out good algorithms for coloring
